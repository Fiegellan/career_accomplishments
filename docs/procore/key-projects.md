## Key Projects and Achievements <a id="procore-key-projects"></a>

- **Data Science Workflow**: Designed and developed a cloud-based Data Science workflow using AWS SageMaker, Terraform, DVC, and GitHub, reducing deployment time from 4 weeks to 1 week.

- **AWS Model Registry**: Developed the AWS Model Registry for the data science team, improving model deployment efficiency by 85%.

- **Custom Aggregation Workflow**: Designed a custom aggregation workflow with Pandas/Dask and AWS EKS, reducing deployment timeline from 10 days to 1 day.

- **Airflow DAG Refactor**: Refactored the Airflow DAG to be OOP, dynamically generating based on configurations, saving up to 60% on time and costs.

- **API Workflow**: Built a full API workflow using AWS SAM, CloudFormation, and API Gateway to make master data sets more accessible.

- **MLOps for Batched Inference**: Implemented MLOps for batched inference jobs leveraging SageMaker.

- **Model Deployment Process**: Built out the model deployment process using GitLab and GitHub for CICD, and implemented a dynamic Airflow DAG creation for new models.

- **Optimized Inference Jobs**: Optimized Airflow SageMaker jobs for inference, cutting run time in half.

- **Data Quality Framework**: Built a full-stack Data Quality Framework leveraging DynamoDB, Lambda, Batch, ECR, and Snowflake.

- **Graph DB for Interconnected Entities**: Developed a Graph DB for interconnected entities.

- **LLM Chatbot**: Built an LLM Chatbot using GPT-3 and LangChain with full front-end functionality using REACT.
